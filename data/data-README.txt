data-README.txt

This is a placeholder file in the GitHub repository: 

https://github.com/proctor-ucsf/CHATON-primary

The first script in the analysis (0-CHATON-Download-Public-Data.R) will download publicly available data from the Open Science Framework and will store it here (in data).  

The original datasets are located on OSF: https://osf.io/s7vrb/

The downloaded datasets are named:

CHATON_full_dataset_public.rds   (individual level file in the analysis sample)  
CHATON_inelig_dataset_public.rds (ineligible children and reasons, for CONSORT)

From these datasets, the scripts in the repository will then run all of the analyses for the CHATON trial primary outcome paper.
